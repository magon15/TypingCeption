# This is a program where you would input any text that you want, and then the program will visually represent how fast you type. This is a great tool that even I use to know if I'm getting close to being a typing Jedi.

What to do:
1) Run the program through cmd.
2) The main GUI will appear, letting you input your text.
3) Press Start. cmd will then begin "typing" at your pace, letting you know how fast you are
